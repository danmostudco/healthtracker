# Health Tracker
A project developed to experiment with backbone.js. The application queries for results from the Nutritionix API, returning brand and calorie count of the food you searched for.

You can then click to add these food items to a list, which then stores your results.

## Running the Application
Run npm install and bower install to add the dependencies to your directory.
